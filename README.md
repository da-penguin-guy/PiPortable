# PiPortable

This is a project that is designed to shove a Pi 5 (Compute module?), a huge battery, and the pi touchscreen into a handheld form-factor. This is meant to help with troubleshooting for audio engineers, although the code is being designed to be very open, allowing you to add your own apps to the launcher and create custom IO Cards

# Source Code
The code can be found in the folder labeled "Source Code." Good luck.
